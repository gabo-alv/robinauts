// The seam of ADR 0001, as lint rules.
//
// assistant-ui exists in exactly one place, `src/chat/assistant-ui/`. What the
// rest of the application may import is `src/chat/index.ts`, an interface this
// project owns, and the rest of the application is everything else: the shell,
// the routes, the API client, the tests.
//
// Three things had to be true for a pattern to be worth anything here, and
// each of them cost a review to learn:
//
//  1. **The implementation is matched by segment, not by prefix.** A path is
//     not its spelling: `../chat/history/../assistant-ui/runtime` and
//     `..//assistant-ui/runtime` reach the same directory as
//     `../assistant-ui/runtime`. What is refused is a specifier with a path
//     segment that *is* `assistant-ui`, wherever in the path it sits.
//  2. **Specifiers are written plainly.** `//`, `/./`, a `..` that is not
//     part of the leading prefix, a trailing `/` -- every one of them is a
//     second spelling of a path, and a rule that reads spellings can only
//     ever chase them. They are refused outright, so there is one spelling of
//     each path for the rules above to read.
//  3. **A specifier that cannot be read cannot be cleared.** A variable, a
//     concatenation, an interpolated template, `import.meta.glob`,
//     `import.meta.resolve`: all refused outside the implementation, because
//     nothing could clear them.
//
// Each restriction is one regular expression, used by `no-restricted-imports`
// for `import`, `export ... from` and `import type`, and by
// `no-restricted-syntax` for `import("...")`, `` import(`...`) `` and
// `new URL("...", import.meta.url)`, none of which the first rule sees.
// Sharing the string is what stops them from drifting apart.
//
// This is a blocking check (docs/specs/open-source.md, "Checks"). Every rule
// fires in `src/test/seam-rule.test.ts`.
