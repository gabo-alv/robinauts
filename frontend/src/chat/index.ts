 * The chat seam (ADR 0001).

 * This module is the only thing about the chat that the rest of the
 * application may import. assistant-ui lives under `src/chat/assistant-ui/`,
 * and nothing outside that directory may name it or its packages;
 * `eslint.config.js` refuses an import that tries.
 *
 * What goes here is a small interface this project owns -- in essence a
 * `<Chat>` taking a conversation id and callbacks -- whose types mention
 * nothing from assistant-ui. Deleting `src/chat/assistant-ui/` and the
 * `@assistant-ui/*` packages must leave exactly one thing broken: the
 * implementation behind this file.
 *
 * What is written here is what the application hands a `<Chat>` and what it
 * needs back from one; nothing in it names, or could name, a chat library.
 * The shell, the router and the history already use these names, so the seam
 * is the one vocabulary the two sides share rather than something invented
 * for the implementation.

 * the conversation being read otherwise. `agentId` is the agent a first
 * message will start the conversation with, which is a choice only while
 * there is no conversation: after that the agent is a fact about it
 * (`docs/specs/conversations.md`). It is `null` when the deployment has told
 * us no agents, or has not told us yet. `modelId` is the model that first
 * message runs on, and `null` leaves it to the agent's default; a
 * conversation's model is changed outside the chat, and no later turn names
 * one, because the server reads it off the conversation.
 *
 * `onConversationStarted` is the one thing the chat cannot decide for the
 * application: a first message creates a conversation
 * (`POST /api/turns`, `docs/specs/wire.md`), and the interface then has a
 * conversation to be on -- a route to go to and a row for the panel. The
 * chat reports the id; what to do about it is the application's.
