 * The chat seam (ADR 0001).

 * This module is the only thing about the chat that the rest of the
 * application may import. assistant-ui lives under `src/chat/assistant-ui/`,
 * and nothing outside that directory may name it or its packages;
 * `eslint.config.js` refuses an import that tries.
 *
 * What goes here is a small interface this project owns -- in essence a
 * `<Chat>` taking a conversation id and callbacks -- whose types mention
 * nothing from assistant-ui. Deleting `src/chat/assistant-ui/` and the
 * `@assistant-ui/*` packages must leave exactly one thing broken: the
 * implementation behind this file.
 *
 * What is written here is what the application hands a `<Chat>` and what it
 * needs back from one; nothing in it names, or could name, a chat library.
 * The shell, the router and the history already use these names, so the seam
 * is the one vocabulary the two sides share rather than something invented
 * for the implementation.
