/**
 * The stops a Tab would actually land on, in order.
 *
 * **What is drawn, not what is written.** This panel holds controls that
 * belong to the other layout -- "Collapse the panel" is `max-md:hidden`, so
 * at drawer width it is `display: none` -- and a selector cannot see that.
 * An element that is not rendered cannot take the focus, so `.focus()` on it
 * does nothing; having already called `preventDefault()`, the trap would
 * then leave the focus where it was and Tab would be dead.
 *
 * Four ways an element is not a stop, and they need different questions:
 *
 * - **`aria-hidden`**: drawn, but not there for a reader. The two must not
 *   disagree about what the panel contains.
 * - **`inert`**: the browser takes a whole subtree out of the tab order.
 *   The panel is never `inert` while the drawer is open -- that is what
 *   `inert` is for when it is closed -- so this only ever matches an inert
 *   subtree *inside* it.
 * - **`visibility: hidden`**: it has a box, so `getClientRects()` says
 *   nothing, and only the computed style does.
 * - **no box at all**: `display: none`, a hidden ancestor,
 *   `content-visibility`. `getClientRects()` is the question a browser
 *   itself answers, and the panel is asked first, because an environment
 *   that lays nothing out (jsdom, which has no layout engine) reports no
 *   boxes for *everything*: filtering on that would drop every stop and
 *   leave a trap that traps nothing. If the panel itself has no box, boxes
 *   are not being computed and the rest of the DOM is all there is to go on.
 *
 * What is **not** covered: an element scrolled out of an overflow container
 * (still a stop, and rightly), `opacity: 0` (still focusable, and still a
 * stop for a browser), and `tabindex` above 0, which nothing here uses and
 * which would reorder the tab sequence rather than leave it in DOM order.
