"""The schema: the file that defines it, applying it, and checking it.

``schema.sql`` beside this module is the whole schema of a deployment, and
it is shipped in the wheel. Nothing here runs at start-up but
``check_schema``: the server never creates or changes the schema on its own,
a command does (``docs/specs/backend.md``), and until that command exists
(step 5 of the plan) these are the functions it will be made of.

**One schema, named once.** ``schema.sql`` creates its tables unqualified, so
they land in ``current_schema()`` -- the first schema on the connection's
``search_path`` that exists. Everything here therefore asks about *that*
schema and no other: a table of ours in the second entry of the path is not
this deployment's table, and a table of somebody else's in the second entry
is none of our business. Judging the whole path instead gets both wrong, in
both directions: a complete schema further along would make an empty one
look finished, and another application's ``users`` would make an empty one
look occupied.

**And the store must reach the same schema.** The stores run unqualified
statements too, so they resolve through the whole path, and a table earlier
on it answering to one of our names would silently take their writes.
``check_schema`` compares the two resolutions and refuses when they differ
(``SchemaError.shadowed``): the contract with the rest of the code is that
**the connection's search path resolves our table names to
``current_schema()``**, which is what a pool built with
``search_path = <the deployment's schema>`` gives, and what
``check_schema`` will not start without.

**Nothing here changes a database it did not make.** There are no migrations
until there is a production deployment, so the only safe things to do to a
database are: create the schema in an empty one, and refuse. ``create_schema``
looks before it writes -- under a lock, so that two of them cannot both
decide the database is empty -- and every refusal is a ``SchemaError`` that
says what was found and what to do. The alternative, applying the file over
whatever is there, looks idempotent and is not: ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT
EXISTS`` leaves an older table exactly as it is, so what it really does is
relabel an old schema as the current one.

**The connection is judged too, not only the database.** A search path that
names no schema, or one that answers our table names from somewhere else,
is refused with its own advice: nothing is wrong with the database, and
``robinauts db init`` would not help.

**A database is complete or it is nothing.** The version row is the last
statement of ``schema.sql``, so it is a claim that everything above it
landed; ``check_schema`` believes it only as far as checking that every
table is there, and is a table rather than a view of the same name.

``SCHEMA_VERSION`` is this build's answer to "which schema was I written
against", and ``SCHEMA_SHA256`` is what the file looked like when that
answer was last true. ``tests/unit/test_datastore_schema.py`` fails if the
file changes and the pin does not.

the search path reaches **before** this one, and that is the only case that
matters. A relation further along the path is harmless -- ours wins as soon
as it exists, which is exactly how a deployment lives beside another
application's ``users``. One in front wins for ever, whether or not ours is
there: before the schema is created it would be created underneath, and
after, the check would pass while every statement went somewhere else.

temporary table is searched first without ever being named on the path.
