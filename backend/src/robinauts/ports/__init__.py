"""What the application needs from the outside world, as abstract base classes.

Depends on ``robinauts.domain`` and on nothing else inside the package
(``docs/layout.md``). The application is handed an implementation of each and
constructs none; the fakes under ``backend/tests/fakes/`` implement these same
classes, and the contract suites say what an implementation must do.
