"""Agents are configuration: the engine that runs one, and how ids are spelt.

An agent is a name, a system prompt, a model and an engine
(``docs/specs/agents.md``); the operator writes them in the configuration and
users do not create them. What the conversation format needs of it is here:
the engine a message was produced by, and the shape of the ids an agent and a
model are referred to by. So are the records an operator's configuration is
read into -- ``AgentDefinition``, ``ModelProviderConfig``, ``ModelConfig`` and
the ``ModelsConfig`` that holds the three tables together.

**The records alone, with no reading of any file.** An adapter reads the TOML
and ``robinauts.core.parse_models_config`` decides whether it describes a
deployment, exactly as sign-in is read (``docs/layout.md``). What is here is
what every layer above needs and the rules each record keeps to.

**No key is ever in one of these.** A provider names the *environment
variable* its key is read from, which is the whole of what the configuration
carries; reading it is the adapter's, and what it read travels in a
``ProviderKeys`` (``robinauts.adapters.config_file``) that prints nothing.
